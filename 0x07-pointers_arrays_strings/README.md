# More  Pointers, Arrays, Strings #

This time we're gonna be working with:

## Double Pointers - It's a pointer that points to another pointer (single pointer) ##

## Buffers - Blocks of memmory that stores the variables and values ## 

## Memmory Blocks - Slots with the size of bytes, where values and variable adresses are stored. ##

Hope you find fun here!
