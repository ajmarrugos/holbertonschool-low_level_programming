# Recursion #

Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way.

In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.

Recursive functions are very useful to solve many mathematical problems, such as calculating the factorial of a number, generating Fibonacci series, etc.
