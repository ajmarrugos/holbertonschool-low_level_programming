# Linked List #

- Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.
- A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.
- The last node of the list contains pointer to the null.

## Uses of Linked List ##
- The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory. The node can reside any where in the memory and linked together to make a list. This achieves optimized utilization of space.
- List size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.
- Empty node can not be present in the linked list.
- We can store values of primitive types or objects in the singly linked list.
