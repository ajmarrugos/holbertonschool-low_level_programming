# Bit Manipulation #

---

- We use Bitwise operators to manipulate data at its lowest level (bit level). Bitwise operators works on each bit of the data.

- Data in the memory (RAM) is organized as a sequence of bytes. Each byte is a group of eight consecutive bits. Bitwise operators are useful when we need to perform actions on bits of the data.

- Bitwise operators work with integer type. They do not support float or real types.

C has six Bitwise operators:

|   Operator    | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|      "&"      | Bitwise AND   |
|      "|"      | Bitwise OR    |
|      "^"      | Bitwise XOR   |
|      "~"      | Commplement   |
|      "<<"     | Left shift    |
|      ">>"     | Right shift   |
